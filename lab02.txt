Problem 1
--------------------------------------------------------

1)
  If we go past the breakpoint, we get a Segmentation Fault (Signal SIGSEGV).

2)
  The file is problem1.c and the line number is 17.

3)
  No we can't see the value that is passed because it was optimized out
  (nptr = <optimized out>).

4)
  0x0 - Null Pointer

5)
  -1835 ([Inferior 1 (process 10269) exited normally])

6)
  argc = 2
  argv[] = [0x7fffffffec33 "/home/jzamudio/Desktop/CS105/Debugger/problem1",
    0x7fffffffec62 "5"]

  The elements of argv[] came from the commands that were passed on the command
  line. The first element is the program name (given by program path) and the
  second element came from the argument passed to run, which was 5. Thus, that
  is why argc has a value of 2.

7)
  We wind up in problem1.c, line 5, in the loop_while function.

8)
  We see the lines of problem1.c up until line 10:

        1	#include <stdio.h>
        2
        3	int loop_while(int a, int b)
        4	{
        5	    int i = 0;
        6	    int result = a;
        7	    while (i < 256) {
        8		result += a;
        9		a -= b;
        10		i += b;

  After hitting the return key, we see the following lines of the program:

        11	    }
        12	    return result;
        13	}
        14
        15	int main(int argc, char *argv[])
        16	{
        17	    printf("%d\n", loop_while(atoi(argv[1]), 16));
        18	    return 0;
        19	}

9)
  The return key runs the program step by step like an instruction counter.

10)
  a = 5
  b = 16
  result = 32767

11)
  Lines 6, 5, 8, 9:

        6 - int result = a;
        5	- int i = 0;
        8	- result += a;
        9	- a -= b;

  The debugger is showing us these lines in this order because the compiler is
  reorganizing the lines for optimization, so they're not in the same order as
  the source code, although switching the order of lines 5 and 6 actually
  doesn't matter.

12)
  atoi: 0x4004ba
  printf: 0x4004e7

13)
